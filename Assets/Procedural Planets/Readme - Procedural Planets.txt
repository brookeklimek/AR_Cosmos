Warnings in Unity 2017.3 and newer: 

Some warnings will be displayed in Unity 2017.3 and newer because
"Procedural Materials" will be deprecated. The procedural materials are based
on technology by Allegorithmic and for Unity 2018.x Allegorithmic will
release their own plugin instead to allow more rapid implementation of
features compared to when it is integrated in Unity as it is today. 
Although this will create a dependency on another component it may come
with the benefit of allowing higher resolution textures, GPU processing for
textures, like in other game engines that use Allegorithmic's own plugin.
I will actively be working to get Unity 2018 to work with this asset as soon
as possible.
